# Income-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project-in-Python

An individual’s annual income results from various factors. Intuitively, it is influenced by the individual’s education level, age, gender, occupation, and etc.

This is a widely cited KNN dataset. It is also a good example for data pre-processing and machine learning.

Fields
- The dataset contains 16 columns
- Target filed: Income
- The income is divide into two classes: <=50K and >50K
- Number of attributes: 14
- These are the demographics and other features to describe a person

We can explore the possibility in predicting income level based on the individual’s personal information.
